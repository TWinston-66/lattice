---- MY PROGRAMS ----
---------------------

-- Set programs that you use. The apps start through `uwsm app --`, which gives each one its
-- own systemd scope instead of leaving it a child of this compositor, so systemd-oomd can
-- kill one app rather than the whole session (modules/nixos/desktop/session.nix). rofi
-- does the same for whatever it launches, from run-command in /etc/xdg/rofi.rasi.

-------------------
---- AUTOSTART ----
-------------------

-- See https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Basics/Autostart/

-- Autostart necessary processes (like notifications daemons, status bars, etc.)
-- Or execute your favorite apps at launch like this:
--
-- hl.on("hyprland.start", function ()
--   hl.exec_cmd(terminal)
--   hl.exec_cmd("nm-applet")
--   hl.exec_cmd("waybar & hyprpaper & firefox")
-- end)

---- ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ----
-------------------------------

-- See https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Advanced-and-Cool/Environment-variables/

-- The cursor theme is the build-time flavour's (modules/nixos/desktop/theming.nix), so it is
-- set from /etc/xdg/hypr/lattice.lua rather than here.

--
-- No focus_on_activate: the app activates its own window a second or two after every
